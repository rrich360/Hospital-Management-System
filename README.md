# Hospital-Management-System
This program displays how hospitals may calculate charges for patients depending on services rendered.


-Collaborated with Sibleyâ€™s Heart Center staff to implement a system that could potentially be used as a concept to populate a hospital bill for patients depending on thier treatment. 
-Additionally, implemented a calculating function to print the total cost of a hospital stay in the scenario of a patient being admitted overnight.  
-A non-profit assignment that allowed further maturation in working in an agile development cycle to build a 
successful management system. 
-Integrated testing environment for debugging and j-unit testing EE Java modules to ensure successful compiling in java console. 
-Incorporated persistent data storage for storing billing information of patients being treated overnight in the hospital. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The following is an example of code that uses the do-while loop to prompt the user to enter costs of medical charges for registering total cost of all charges while there is still a patient to bill :

The following is an example of when I implemented a method to check if a patient stayed overnight at a hospital and prompts the user to type in the cost of the overnight stay :

The following is the result of calculations done for two patients in a hospital and ends the loop when the user enters "n" for NO patients available :
