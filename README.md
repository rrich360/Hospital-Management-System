# Hospital-System
This program displays how hospitals may calculate charges for patients depending on services rendered.


-Collaborated with Sibleyâ€™s Heart Center staff to implement a system that could potentially be used as a concept to populate a hospital bill for patients depending on thier treatment. 
-Additionally, implemented a calculating function to print the total cost of a hospital stay in the scenario of a patient being admitted overnight.  
-A non-profit assignment that allowed further maturation in working in an agile development cycle to build a 
successful management system. 
-Integrated testing environment for debugging and j-unit testing EE Java modules to ensure successful compiling in java console. 
-Incorporated persistent data storage for storing billing information of patients being treated overnight in the hospital.
